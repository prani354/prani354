## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 Okra Maturity Analysis using Machine Vision
- Implemented machine vision techniques to classify okra maturity levels.
- Used image preprocessing, feature extraction, and ML models for prediction.
- Explored thermal imaging patterns for improved accuracy.

### 🔹 Agriculture Monitoring System using GSM Module
- This system monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity using sensors to provide real-time data. It sends SMS alerts to farmers for timely actions to farmers for timely actions to optimize crop growth and water usage.
- Tech used: Python , GSM , Moisture and Temperature sensors

### 🔹 Obstacle Avoidance Smart Robot
- A smart robot equipped with sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles autonomously, ensuring efficient and
collision-free movement and it uses real-time data processing and adaptive algorithms to adjust its path and avoid
obstructionst.
- Tech Used: Embedded C, Arduino, Microcontroller, Ultrasonic sensor, L293 Driver module.

### 🔹 Anti Passback System
- A security system using RFID technology to prevent unauthorized access by ensuring that a tag is not used for entry
multiple times without exiting, thereby ensuring proper access control and enhanced security at entry points.
- Tech Used: C, Arduino, RFID

### 🔹 Product Recommendation System
- A machine learning-based recommendation system that uses K-means clustering to group users based on their preferences and suggest personalized products. It enhances user experience by delivering tailored suggestions, improving
engagement and satisfaction
- Tech Used: Python, K-means clustering, ML algorithms

### 🔹 Ultrasonic Glass using Arduino
- Developed an ultrasonic-based smart glass using Arduino to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting nearby
obstacles. The system alerts the user through vibration or sound feedback based on object proximity
- Tech Used: Arduino , Embedded C
